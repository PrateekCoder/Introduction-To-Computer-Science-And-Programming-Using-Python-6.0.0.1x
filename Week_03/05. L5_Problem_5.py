The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is the largest integer that divides each of them without remainder. For example,

gcd(2, 12) = 2

gcd(6, 12) = 6

gcd(9, 12) = 3

gcd(17, 12) = 1

A clever mathematical trick (due to Euclid) makes it easy to find greatest common divisors. Suppose that a and b are two positive integers:

If b = 0, then the answer is a

Otherwise, gcd(a, b) is the same as gcd(b, a % b)

See this website for an example of Euclid's algorithm being used to find the gcd.

Write a function gcdRecur(a, b) that implements this idea recursively. This function takes in two positive integers and returns one integer.

def gcdRecur(a, b):

    a, b: positive integers
